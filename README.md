# Kata_ValidatePin
Firts Kata and NUnit test implementation

This code was created only due to a test in CodeWars.
Also, this was the first time I ever used NUnit to perform tests. So it can also be considerate a pilot to this
sort of practice.

## Parameters:

Each string submitted should be of length 6 or 4, not containing anything but digits.

## Developers:
